## Overview
### Description
This app lets backpack travelers create a social media where they can share recommendations of different places to visit along their journey to a destination. Users can add a destination and the app will show the route to take, with points of the recommendations other backpack travelers have gone to and recommended. Users can also post a recommendation of the places they went through the journey and want to recommend to other backpackers.
